# Census Folium Tutorial

[Click here](https://kburchfiel3.wordpress.com/2022/01/13/census-folium-tutorial/) to read my blog post about this program. 

This project demonstrates how to use Folium to generate interactive zip-, county-, and state-level choropleth maps. As part of this project, I wrote a function for creating a vertical legend as an alternative to the default horizontal one, as I find vertical legends to be easier to read in certain circumstances. (See the images below for examples of this custom legend.)

Note: some files were too large to be included within the GitHub repository. You can find those additional files at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11h1jnaVOA5A6ubbOJnC-kPEvdnJU00yv?usp=sharing.


## Screenshots

Here are example screenshots of the choropleth maps currently stored in this repository. (The original maps are .html files, so for the best viewing experience, I recommend downloading them to your computer and then opening them in a web browser. These screenshots don't display the interactive popup data stored in the .html maps.)

### Demographic data:

Note that the zip- and county-level maps contain data from the ACS 2019 community survey (5-year averages), whereas the state-level maps contain data from the ACS 2019 community survey.

Also note that these maps only show counties and zip codes with at least 1,000 households.

**The proportion of households in each zip code that consist of a married couple with at least one child:**

**Median household income by zip code:**
